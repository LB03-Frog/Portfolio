<!--Accessibility considerations
Opening links in a new tab or window can cause accessibility issues. Here are some reasons why: Links opening in a new tab can prove disorienting for people with low vision or are navigating via screen reader, especially when there is no warning. However, using iframe to package content within a modal also raises accessibility concerns-->

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>I believe that the act of making, specifically in modern times, is strongly linked to rhetoric, technology, and ethics. When we create things in this class we will be using many different technologies as a medium for making. We will creating things to share our opinion with others and learning how to do that most effectivly. To ensure our designs are etheical, we will be adding accessibility features to our designs to ensure everyone can experiance our designs.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>Design principles provide a foundation for creating meaningful and professional work. By applying concepts such as balance, contrast, alignment, proximity, and repetition, we learn to shape both the message and the visual impact of a project. These principles give us a shared vocabulary for design that helps us strengthen our ideas and communicate more clearly with different audiences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>Workshops emphasize collaboration and respect, helping us improve by listening to others and offering constructive feedback. By participating actively, we learn how our peers interpret our projects and how we can support their growth in return. This mutual process of critique and revision builds trust and sharpens our ability to refine ideas through dialogue.</p>

              <p>Revision is essential in moving from small ideas to larger, more polished projects. In this course we will practice scaling our work, translating designs across multiple media, and experimenting with how form affects meaning. These revisions allow us to push our projects further, ensuring that what we make develops into clear, effective, and engaging communication.</p>

              <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
              <p>Presentation requires us to explain not only what we made but also why and how we made it. Sharing the theory, method, and design choices behind a project helps audiences understand our work and connect with it on a deeper level. Through oral presentations and portfolio-building, we will practice communicating both the process and the purpose of our designs.</p>
